# Data Mining Assignment 2

This assignment is to classify the time series based glucose level data as meal with label 1 and no meal with label 0.
The training data for both the classification is given and we trained our model using LogisticRegression,
Decision Tree, SVM and Random forest.

## Testing the assignment

  1. Place the test file in the Dataset > RawTestData Folder
  2. As the model already trained and stored as the pickle file, Please navigate
     inside the Code folder and run the `Predict.py`
     ```bash
        > cd Code
        > python3 Predict.py
     ```
  3. Once the `Predict.py` runs successfully, Please navigate to the result folder
   in the same directory (Code) to view the results of each classifier.

    Note: The result files will be generated only when you run the Predict.py

## Files and it's usage

`Extract_Data.py` - Appends the meal/nomeal labels i.e 1/0 for the corresponding
                  files of all 5 patients. Cleans the data by replacing NaN values
                  with mean from previous data. It then calls Feature_Extraction
                  function.

`Feature_Extraction.py` - Calling the API creates the following features -CGM velocity,
                        CGM displacement, count of local maxima and minima per interval
                        and shifted mean.

`Cross Validation.py` - It does the cross validation and calls extract data and for each
                      fold it does pca / Minmax scaler on the train data and uses the
                      same weights to only transform the test data.

`PCA_Reduction.py` -  Reduces the data dimensions of data to 3 features after recognizing
                    largely varying features and transforming them.

`ModelUtility.py` -  It saves the Model as the pickle file and it loads it up while
                   testing.

`Train.py` -  It trains the data with all the classifier and save the trained classifier
            as a pickle file in the Model directory.

`Predict.py` -  It contains the function call to run the four classifiers â€“
              Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier.
